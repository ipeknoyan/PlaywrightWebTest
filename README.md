# PlaywrightWebTest
 This project tests counting number of career categories in "https://tesonet.com/". There is a simple test case which created with Page Object Model and runnig on two browsers chromium and firefox.
 
# Technology & Stack
 I used Playwright framework and devloped the test case with Typescript because there are several adventages of using Playwright framework which are Easy Setup and Configuration, Multi-Browser Support, Multi-Language Support, Parallel Browser Testing, Built-in Reporters(Dot, Line, JSON, JUnit, and HTML Reporters), zero configuration is required for typescript language support as it understands your typescript and javascript code, CI/CD Integration Support. On the other hand it is a framework that it’s still evolving, it is working only for web and doesn’t support Native Mobile Apps.
 
 # Installation & Run
 Prerequisites - Nodejs v16.15.1
 Execute "npm install" to install packages
 Execute npx playwright test to run the tests
 
# Next Possible Steps for Improvements
 -Test scenarios can be created with BDD method.
 -Reports can be custimized according to requirements.
 -Test scenarios can be integrated with Jenkins to create a CI/CD pipeline.
